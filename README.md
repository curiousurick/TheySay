# TheySay
This app allows you to look at whatever people are talking about concerning a video you are watching.


You can view public posts about the video from Facebook, tweets on Twitter, as well as the actual video using the Youtube API. 

Installation:

1. Clone from this Repo

2. Try to build and run the app

2a. If you do not have Fabric installed, some crazy magic will probably open up the Fabric website. This is a Twitter framework and is safe, but used to access tweets.

2b. Install Fabric.

3. Build and run the app again on a simulator or your phone.
