# TheySay

This app is using a parse database, so please don't overuse the API (more than 30 requests/second) or I'll have to shut down the database.

This app allows you to look at whatever people are talking about concerning a video you are watching.

Logging in through Facebook allows for authentication to see tweets.

You can see tweets on Twitter, as well as the actual video using the Youtube API. You can also tweet the link to the video with two taps.

You can also save tweets that you like and by swipe from the right, you can view your saved tweets as well as delete them from that list.

(I know YouSay is a horrible name, but I spent 6 hours trying to change the name because Xcode crashes when you try, and destroys the .xcodeproj file. (Thank God for github))

Installation:

1. Clone from this Repo

2. Try to build and run the app

2a. If you do not have Fabric installed, some crazy magic will probably open up the Fabric website. This is a Twitter framework and is safe, but used to access tweets.

2b. Install Fabric.

3. Build and run the app again on a simulator or your phone.
